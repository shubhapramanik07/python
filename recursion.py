#* in python an infinite recursion occurs when a function calls itself without a base case or termination condition, leading to a stack overflow error. to avoid infinite recursion, ensure that your recursive functions have a clear base case and that the input is modified in each recursive call to eventually reach that base case.

    #* here in python it calls itself by default limit of 987 times
